Recap: Named registers
^
======================

We can use the `["x]` notation to prefix a named register in front of many of
Vim's operations, including `d`, `y`, and `p` (cut, copy, and paste).

Named registers are handy if you want to cut or copy multiple regions of text
that you intend to paste later.
