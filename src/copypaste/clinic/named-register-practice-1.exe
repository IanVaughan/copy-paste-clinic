Exercise: working with named registers (1/2)
============================================

Cut this to register A:
    (about )
    ^

Cut this to register B:
    (be )
    ^

Cut this to register C:
    (see )
    ^

First, yank the contents of each set of parentheses into registers A, B, and C.

1. Yank the first URL into register A by pressing `"ayi)`
2. Jump to the next location by pressing `<right>`
3. Yank the next URL into register B by pressing `"byi)`
4. Jump to the next location by pressing `<right>`
5. Yank the next URL into register C by pressing `"cyi)`

Use the `:reg` command to check that you did it right. The output should look
like this:

    :reg abc
    --- Registers ---
    "a   about
    "b   be
    "c   see

Advance to the next lesson by pressing `<right>`.
