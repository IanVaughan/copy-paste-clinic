Lesson: replace document text by deleting to blackhole register
===============================================================

    collection = getCollection();
    process(obstacleToBeRemoved, target);

We've already learned that Vim's delete operation is better described as a cut
operation: not only does it remove text from the document, it also writes the
text to a register. You might be wondering, in that case, is there any way of
truly deleting text? Vim's answer is slightly oddball: you can write to the
blackhole register.

Nothing returns from the blackhole register. Itâ€™s the Vim register equivalent
of /dev/null. To perform a true deletion in Vim, prefix the delete command with
"_ for example: "_diw would delete the current word without saving a copy in a
register. Let's try it:

1. Yank the word 'collection' by pressing `yiw`
2. Inspect the default register by running: :reg "
3. Jump to the next location by pressing `<right>`
4. Delete 'obstacleToBeRemoved' and write to blackhole by pressing `"_diw`
5. Inspect the default register by running: :reg "
6. Put the text from the default register by pressing `P`
