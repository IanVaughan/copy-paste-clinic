Lesson: be able to strike from any position
===========================================

We've just seen a couple of edge cases where it was necessary to use either `p`
or `P` to insert text in the intended location. We won't meet either of those
situations in this exercise. All of the exercises below could be completed using
the `p` command, by first moving the cursor into the appropriate position. But
in every case, the exercise can be completed with a single keystroke.

Don't think about it too hard! If `p` doesn't work, undo the change and try
again. You'll end up typing `puP` or `Pup`, and that's ok. Eventually, you'll
develop an intution for which put command will work for the current context. It
takes practice, but eventually you won't even have to think about it, your
fingers will just do the right thing.
