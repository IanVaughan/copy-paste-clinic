Lesson: be able to strike from any position
===========================================

Want some more practice? These exercises look a lot like the ones in the
previous chapter, except you'll be pasting the text ' has' (instead of 'has ').

1. Press `yi)` to yank the text inside the parentheses
2. Use <Right> to jump to the next exercise
3. paste the word you yanked in the correct position using `p` or `P`
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until finished

Yank inside parens: ( has)

1. This sentence no verb
2. Vim many modes of operation.
3. This sentence no verb
4. I can cheeseburger?
5. Where my mojo gone?
6. Vim many modes of operation.

Don't think about it too hard! If `p` doesn't work, undo the change and try
again. You'll end up typing `puP` or `Pup`, and that's ok. Eventually, you'll
develop an intution for which put command will work for the current context.
You won't even have to think about it, your fingers will just do the right
thing.
